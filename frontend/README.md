# ArcadeStore Frontend

This README file provides information about the frontend application of the ArcadeStore project.

## Overview

The frontend application is built using JavaScript and serves as the user interface for the ArcadeStore project. It is designed to provide a seamless experience for users to interact with the arcade store functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   Open your terminal and change the directory to the frontend folder:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   To start the development server, execute:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the application, and you can view it in your web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `src/index.js`: The main entry point for the frontend application.
- `package.json`: Contains the configuration for npm, including scripts and dependencies.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration). You can make changes to the source files, and the application will automatically reload to reflect those changes.
